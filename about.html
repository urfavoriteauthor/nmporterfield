        <h1 class="animated tada">About N.M. Porterfield</h1>
        <p> Everyone has a story to tell. But N.M. Porterfield is a paragon for the creative writing process. Whether
            its writing books or comic books, making music, or writing poems and screen plays, N.M. thrives in literary
            artistic expression. His insatiable need to create new worlds, characters and stories that explore the
            realms of reality and challenging the notions of what is possible. </p>

        <p> N.M. Began writing at the age of 7. Although his work was mostly with poetry, his love of freely creating
            imaginative worlds was cemented at that time. This was coupled with his fascination for fantasy in film and
            television as he often wondered what it would be like to create characters and worlds of his own. From
            superheroes to worlds of magic and advanced technology, there was nothing that N.M. felt he couldnâ€™t create.
            The possibilities were endless, and so was his desire to create.</p>

        <p>By his early twenties N.M. had begun working on his first book titled "The Lovers Man-ual". It took him
            nearly three years to complete, after going back and forth to ensure he had fully told the story that he
            wanted to tell. In 2015, it was released to the public. The book, which is a strategy
            guide for dating, followed his own experiences and added in advice for how to effectively navigate the world
            of romance. Although he self published, the book was a relative success. He sold out of his first shipment
            in less than 30 days.<img src="assets/images/urfavoriteauthor.jpg" width="700px" style="float:right"></p>

        <p> Becoming more comfortable with his own creative writing process and following the success of "The Lovers
            Man-ual", N.M. released the first book of his most popular series "Thrill of
            the Hunt". "Thrill of the Hunt" was his first fictional work and was one of his most well received books by
            readers. It followed the story of a young man who, after his mother's murder, was taken in by a secret society
            and raised to be an assassin. But the skills he learned as an assassin, soon became necessary for his own
            survival as he is targeted by the same people who trained him. </p>

        <p>With the success of those first two books, N.M. Had an explosion of creativity. He spent a year doing
            nothing but writing and was able to finish over 20 books in that time. N.M. also wanted to return to his
            roots and release a collection of poetry, his first artistic love. He
            released two books of poetry. The first titled "The Missing Piece" and the second "Levels" both of which tell, not only his story but also
            capture his worldview and his experiences in poetic rhyme. N.M. also was always a fan of comic books and had
             envisioned creating his own comic book universe. So by
            utilizing his writing skills and partnering with various artistic talents he created several different comic
            book series such as G.H.O.S.T, Hero city Rejects, and Golem Gladiators Rock.Beyond writing books and comics, N.M. has begun working on his first screen play which he hopes to direct
            himself.</p>

        <p>  As a husband and father of two boys, N.M. Continues to share his creativity with the world by
            creating works that can reach everyone.One of the most important staples for his
            writing is ensuring that he provides opportunities for characters who typically don't get representation to
            have their stories told. To N.M., ensuring that new stories are told with new faces, is a necessary part of
            true artistic expression. N.M. wants to inspire others through his own creativity by pushing
            his own limits and breaking down the barriers to creativity, one story at a time. </p>
